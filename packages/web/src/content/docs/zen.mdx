title: Zen
description: Curated list of models provided by opencode.

import config from "../../../config.mjs"
export const console = config.console
export const email = `mailto:${config.email}`

opencode zen is a list of tested and verified models provided by the opencode team.

:::note
opencode zen is currently in beta.
:::

Zen works like any other provider in opencode. You login to opencode zen and get
your API key. It's **completely optional** and you don't need to use it to use
opencode.

---

## Background

There are a large number of models out there but only a few of
these models work well as coding agents. Additionally, most providers are
configured very differently; so you get very different performance and quality.

:::tip
We tested a select group of models and providers that work well with opencode.
:::

So if you are using a model through something like OpenRouter, you can never be
sure if you are getting the best version of the model you want.

To fix this, we did a couple of things:

1. We tested a select group of models and talked to their teams about how to
   best run them.
2. We then worked with a few providers to make sure these were being served
   correctly.
3. Finally, we benchmarked the combination of the model/provider and came up
   with a list that we feel good recommending.

opencode zen is an AI gateway that gives you access to these models.

## How it works

opencode zen works like any other provider in opencode.

1. You sign in to **<a href={console}>opencode zen</a>** and get your API key.
2. You run `opencode auth login` and select opencode and add your API key.
3. Run `/models` in the TUI to see the list of models we recommend.

You are charged per request and you can add credits to your account.

## Goals

We created opencode zen to:

1. **Benchmark** the best models/providers for coding agents.
2. Have access to the **highest quality** options and not downgrade performance or route to cheaper providers.
3. Pass along any **price drops** by selling at cost; so the only markup is to cover our processing fees.
4. Have **no lock-in** by allowing you to use it with any other coding agent. And always let you use any other provider with opencode as well.
